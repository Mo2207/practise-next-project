This project is still being worked on, but by completion I would like it to have the following features:

Modern Tech Stack: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive styling.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Optimized Images: Leveraging Next.js Image component for optimized and lazy-loaded images.
Forms: Functional forms for customer inquiries.
